----------

This project contains a design of a JFET (Junction Field-Effect Transistor) Type N, demonstrating its characteristics and behavior.

## Files

The main file in this project is:

- `N_Jfet.slx`: This file contains the design of the JFET Type N.

## JFET Type N

A JFET (Junction Field-Effect Transistor) is a type of field-effect transistor that uses a junction. In a Type N JFET, the channel is n-type semiconductor material.

## How to Use

1. Open the `N_Jfet.slx` file in MATLAB Simulink.
2. Analyze the design to understand the behavior of a JFET Type N.
