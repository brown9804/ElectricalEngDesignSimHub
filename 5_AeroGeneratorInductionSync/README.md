## Simulation and analysis of an induction and synchronous wind turbine model

This document presents the study of wind turbines. The analysis is focused on models that conform to the dimensions, parameters, and control characteristics of the system. For this purpose, the simulation was divided into two parts. We managed to obtain the simulations of the currents through the rotor and stator of two different models.
