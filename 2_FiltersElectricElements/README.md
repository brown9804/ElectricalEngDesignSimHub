----------

This repository contains resources and scripts for creating filters using electric elements.

## Overview

The aim of this repository is to provide a comprehensive guide and tools for designing and implementing filters using electrical components such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors. These filters can be used in a variety of applications, from audio processing to signal conditioning in electronics systems.

1. **Low-Pass Filters**
2. **High-Pass Filters** 
3. **Band-Pass Filters**
4. **Band-Stop Filters**
